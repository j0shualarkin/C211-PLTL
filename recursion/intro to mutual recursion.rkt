;; - (make-section Symbol ListOfBook ListOfBook)

(define-struct section [letter in out])

;; A Book is a:
;; - (make-book String String Boolean)
(define-struct book [author title status copies])
;; status refers to whether or not the book is checked in or out
;; a book is not in the /system/ if it cannot be found

;; to make it easier, we can place books into our system by the first char in the author
;;   by using the following notation : Last, First
